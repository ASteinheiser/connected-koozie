# Connected Koozie

Strap a Tiny Tile to any koozie and make it a smart koozie! Using the built in accelerometer data, Meshblu, and a nueral network(of some kind), the smart koozie will let you know when you have taken a sip of your drink. This could be used for IoT drinking games, personal health, etc.
